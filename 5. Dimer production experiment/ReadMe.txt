These files conatain experimental data for dimer formation in oresence or absence of proofreader strands.

For dimerisation experiments done individually, P6, P7, and P8 were tested.

For dimerisation experiments from a mixture of monomers, only P6 and P7 were tested.

The reactions followed here are:

M1L + N + P + T --> M1N + M1P + T + L (with proofreader; also for M2 and M3)

M1L + N + T --> M1N + T + L (without proofreader; also for M2 and M3)

M1N + RQ --> M1NR + Q
